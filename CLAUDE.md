# BCA Asset Tracker

A school IT/facilities asset tracker for Brookside Christian Academy (Atascadero, CA),
originally built as a Claude.ai artifact and migrated to a standalone static site so it
could connect to a live Google Sheets backend (Claude.ai's artifact sandbox blocks
outbound network requests to arbitrary domains, which is why this migration happened).

## Files

- `index.html` — the entire app. No build step, no npm install. React, ReactDOM,
  lucide-react (icons), and xlsx (SheetJS, for the Excel export button) are all loaded
  from esm.sh/unpkg via an import map. Babel Standalone transpiles the JSX in-browser
  at load time. To edit: just edit the JSX inline inside the `<script type="text/babel">`
  block and reload — no build/compile step exists or is needed.
- `AssetTrackerSync.gs` — Google Apps Script backend, pasted into the Apps Script editor
  bound to a Google Sheet, deployed as a Web App. This is NOT part of the static site
  deploy — it lives entirely inside Google's infrastructure. If you change this file,
  you must re-paste it into the Apps Script editor and create a **new deployment
  version** (Deploy > Manage deployments > pencil icon > Version: New version > Deploy).
  Just saving the script does not update the live `/exec` URL.

## Architecture

- **Top-level navigation**: `mainTab` ("assets" | "maintenance") switches the main page
  between the asset list (`view === "list"`) and a site-wide Maintenance overview — every
  asset's `maintenanceItems` flattened into one sortable-by-urgency table (`allMaintenanceRows`).
  Both live inside the same `view === "list"` screen; opening an asset (either tab) still
  goes through `openDetail()` into `view === "detail"`, and `openDetail(asset, "maintenance")`
  jumps straight to that asset's Maintenance sub-tab — used by the overview's row click.
- **State**: the whole app is one component (`AssetTracker`) holding all state — assets,
  managed lists (change types, vendors, peripherals, users), audit log, column config.
- **Persistence model**: the app keeps its full state in memory and, on every change,
  sends the ENTIRE state as one JSON snapshot to the Apps Script backend (`persist()` ->
  `writeSnapshot()` -> `fetch(SHEET_API_URL, { method: "POST", ... })`). On load, it does
  one GET to the same URL and reconstructs everything (`useEffect` near the top of the
  component). No per-field diffing on the client — but `persist()` does compute which
  *domains* changed (`_dirty: { assets, config }`), via plain reference-equality against
  current state (every call site already either passes a domain through untouched or a
  freshly computed value, so this needs no per-call-site bookkeeping). `AssetTrackerSync.gs`'s
  `doPost` uses that to skip rewriting the Assets/Comments/Changes/Allocations/Maintenance
  tabs when nothing asset-related changed, and skip Config when no managed list or column
  changed — e.g. toggling a managed-list entry no longer rewrites the Assets tab, and vice
  versa. AuditLog is handled differently again: since entries are only ever appended to
  (never edited or deleted client-side), `appendNewRows_` appends just the new rows instead
  of rewriting the whole — ever-growing — history each time. A request with no `_dirty` at
  all (an old client, or a direct API call) still rewrites everything, as the safe fallback.
  `LockService` still guards every write so concurrent saves don't corrupt a tab.
- **Sheet schema**: Assets tab holds flat fields only (see `ASSET_FIELDS` in the .gs
  file). Comments, Changes (structured change log with type/vendor/cost), Allocations
  (bulk-item quantity assignments), and Maintenance (scheduled maintenance items) each
  live in their own tab, keyed by the asset's `label` (its asset ID, e.g. `BCA0001`).
  Breakers (keyed by `panelLabel`) and Circuits (keyed by `breakerId`, one level deeper —
  see Data model) are the same pattern with an extra level of nesting. Config tab stores
  the managed lists and column config as JSON blobs (key/value rows), since those aren't
  naturally tabular.
- **Personal identity**: a lightweight, unverified "who's using this browser" name tag
  is stored in `localStorage` (not the Sheet) — used only to stamp comments/changes/edits
  with an author name. Not real auth.
- **Column visibility is per-device**, also `localStorage` (`COLUMN_VISIBILITY_STORAGE_KEY`),
  not the Sheet. Column *definitions* (key/label/width/custom flag) stay server-synced via
  Config, since a custom column adds a real field to every asset — only which columns are
  *shown* is local. `isColumnVisible(c)` reads the local override first, falling back to the
  column's server-defined `visible` (e.g. for a custom column another device just added, which
  this device hasn't seen/hidden yet). `toggleColumnVisible()` never calls `persist()`.
- **`ChildEntityTable`** (bottom of the file) is a generic list/add/edit/delete component for
  a structured child entity (fields config + items + onAdd/onSave/onDelete), built for
  Breakers and Circuits and intended for reuse — Locks under Doors is planned next and will
  need the identical list/add/edit/move shape. It owns its own add/edit/expand/delete-confirm
  UI state; the caller supplies data + callbacks, plus `renderCustomFields` for anything that
  doesn't fit the generic field-type system (text/number/date/select/multiselect) — used for
  a Circuit's rooms-served-vs-feeds-sub-panel toggle. Actions that aren't a generic field edit
  (Swap Breaker, Move Circuit) live outside the component via `customRowActions`, which opens
  the caller's own dedicated modal.

## Data model

Assets have a `type`: Computer, Monitor, Phone, TV, DocuCam, Stream Deck, Room, Building,
Bulk Item, Electrical Panel, or Other. Which fields apply to which type is governed by `TYPE_ONLY_FIELDS`
and the `*_EXCLUDED_FIELDS` arrays near the top of the file (`fieldAppliesTo()`) — e.g.
Room and Building assets don't have brand/model/serial; Bulk Items (chairs, tables — not
individually tagged) get a `totalQuantity` and an `itemName` instead, and are distributed
across rooms via their own `allocations` array rather than a single `room` field.
`itemName` ("Sub-Type" in the UI) is picked from a managed list (`bulkItemTypes`, editable
via the gear icon, same pattern as peripherals/vendors/change types) rather than freeform
text, so it stays consistent — and the list view's Type column shows a Bulk Item's
sub-type plus a small "BULK" badge instead of the literal "Bulk Item" for every row.

Rooms link to Buildings (`building` field, dropdown of existing Building assets); devices
link to Rooms (`room` field, dropdown of existing Room assets); a device's building is
inferred transitively through its Room (see `inferBuilding()`), not stored directly.

Every asset carries: `comments` (freeform notes), `changes` (structured: type/vendor/
cost/note — its own managed lists, editable via gear-icon "manage" buttons), and is
covered by a global `auditLog` that automatically records creates/edits/archives/
deletes/allocations (see `logAudit()`, `describeAudit()`) — this is separate from
`changes` and isn't user-authored.

Assets are archived (soft-deleted, `status: "Archived"`) rather than deleted by default;
permanent deletion is a separate, more heavily confirmed action only available on an
already-archived asset.

Every asset (any type) also has a `maintenanceItems` array — scheduled maintenance
entries with `task`, `frequencyLabel`/`frequencyDays` (picked from the fixed
`MAINTENANCE_FREQUENCIES` list, not a managed list, since a day-count is needed to
compute a next-due date), `lastPerformed`, and `owner` (freeform text). `nextMaintenanceDue()`
and `maintenanceStatusOf()` derive a next-due date and a status (`never` / `overdue` /
`due-soon` / `ok`) used to sort the Maintenance tab (most urgent first) and to flag the
tab itself in red when anything's overdue. Adding an item isn't separately audited (its
own `at`/`by` is enough); marking done, editing, or deleting one is, since those mutate
or remove data with no other history trail.

**Electrical Panel** assets (`type: "Electrical Panel"`) are otherwise device-like — real
brand/model/serial, purchase date, warranty, room placement via `inferBuilding()` like any
other device — they just don't have `peripherals` (`ELECTRICAL_PANEL_EXCLUDED_FIELDS`). Each
carries a `breakers` array (own Breakers tab in the detail view), one level deeper than
anything else in the app: **Circuit → Breaker → Panel**. Breakers and Circuits are *not*
Assets themselves (don't appear in the main list, no independent archive) but get a real
`crypto.randomUUID()` id, since they get swapped/moved and other records point at them —
array position can't serve as identity once things move.

- A Breaker's `slots` is an explicit array of slot numbers (not a single position + inferred
  second slot) — the one representation that covers single-pole (`["5"]`), double-pole/
  240V (`["1","3"]` — stacked rows in the same column, not adjacent numbers), and tandem
  (two breakers both listing the same slot, `mount: "tandem"` on both) without a special-cased
  inference rule. A slot may be shared by more than one breaker only if every breaker sharing
  it is `mount: "tandem"` — enforced client-side in `addBreaker`/`saveBreakerEdit`.
- **Swap Breaker** (`openSwapBreaker`/`submitSwapBreaker`) is a distinct action from the
  generic edit, for the common case of physically replacing a breaker — logs `breaker_swapped`
  with old/new serial. It keeps the same `id` and slot(s). The generic edit form can also
  touch serial/ampRating/installedDate (logged as `breaker_edited` field diffs); Swap is the
  recommended path for a physical replacement, not the only way to change those fields.
- A Circuit's `Circuit.feedsPanelLabel` marks it as feeding a downstream sub-panel instead of
  serving rooms directly (`roomsServed`) — mutually exclusive, enforced in `addCircuit`/
  `saveCircuitEdit`. A panel's "fed from" info is never stored on the Panel itself — it's
  found by searching all circuits for `feedsPanelLabel === thisPanelLabel` at render time,
  the same "computed, not stored" principle `inferBuilding()` already uses for a device's
  building.
- **Move Circuit** (`openMoveCircuit`/`submitMoveCircuit`) reassigns a circuit to a different
  breaker — **same panel only** in this pass; moving to a different Panel asset would mean
  mutating two assets atomically and is deferred as a follow-up.
- Deleting a breaker with circuits attached, or a circuit's roomsServed/feedsPanelLabel
  exclusivity, is validated client-side only (`canDeleteBreaker`, `addCircuit`) — consistent
  with every other guard in this app (delete/archive confirmations etc.); nothing else
  validates server-side either, so making this one check the exception wouldn't close a real
  gap. Breakers/Circuits carry no `at`/`by` of their own (unlike comments/changes/maintenance
  items), so — like Allocations — every mutation (add/edit/swap/move/remove) is audited, with
  `snake_case` action names: `breaker_added`, `breaker_edited`, `breaker_swapped`,
  `breaker_removed`, `circuit_added`, `circuit_edited`, `circuit_reassigned`, `circuit_removed`.

## Known constraints / things to watch

- No auth beyond the cosmetic name tag — anyone with the deployed URL can read/write
  everything. Fine for internal school use with a private link; not a public-facing
  security model.
- Apps Script free-tier quota is ~90 min of script runtime/day — comfortably enough
  for this app's usage pattern, but worth knowing if it ever gets flaky under heavy
  simultaneous use.
- No conflict detection: if two people save at nearly the same moment, last write wins
  and can silently drop the other person's change (each save is a full overwrite).
- Deferred features discussed but not built: a physical audit/walkthrough mode, live
  auto-refresh of stale data between users, audit log pruning, cross-panel circuit moves
  (same-panel only today — see Move Circuit above).
- **Planned next**: Doors/Locks/Keys, reusing `ChildEntityTable`. Keying is many-to-many (one
  key opens many locks), not a tree like Panel→Breaker→Circuit — will need its own join-table
  design (`LockKeys`) and its own facility-wide view, not bolted onto the Panels tree pattern.
